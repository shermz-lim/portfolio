            Taught/teaching in: AY20/21 Sem 1, AY20/21 Sem 2.
            <br />I go through problem sets during tutorial lessons on the
            design and implementation of foundational data structures and
            algorithms, as well as interesting applications of these concepts.
            The module topics include: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash
            tables, binary heaps, trees, graphs, searching and sorting
            algorithms, and the analysis of algorithms.
