          Hi, I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the National
          University of Singapore. I am also under the University Scholars
          Program.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am aspiring to be a Software Engineer and have done a couple of
          software engineering internships, including at Rakuten last summer. I
          enjoy solving programming puzzles, and have recently gotten into
          competitive programming where I get to do a lot of that. I am also a
          Teaching Assistant at the National University of Singapore for the
          Data Structures and Algorithms module.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy movies and books.</p>
